# TODO Application Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a TODO application. The application will be a web-based solution allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently. It will be built using a modern tech stack including React for the frontend and AWS serverless architecture for the backend.

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Features**:
  - Task creation, editing, and deletion
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
  - No user authentication required

## Backend
- **Architecture**: AWS Serverless
- **Tools**: AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)
- **Services**:
  - AWS Lambda for executing backend logic
  - Amazon DynamoDB for storing tasks
  - Amazon API Gateway for API endpoints
  - AWS Cognito configured for unauthenticated access

## User Flow
1. **Access the application**: Users visit the GitHub Pages hosted site.
2. **Manage tasks**: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks without logging in.
3. **Data storage**: Tasks are stored in DynamoDB, accessed via API Gateway.

## Security
- Use AWS Cognito to allow unauthenticated access, ensuring that users can interact with the application without logging in.

## Deployment
- **Frontend**: Continuous deployment to GitHub Pages.
- **Backend**: Deploy using AWS CDK, ensuring infrastructure as code.

## Conclusion
This TODO application aims to provide a seamless task management experience with a focus on simplicity and accessibility. The use of serverless architecture ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness.
